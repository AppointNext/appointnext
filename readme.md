Thank You!!!

## Features

- Easy appointment scheduling and management
- Patient record keeping
- Notifications and reminders for upcoming appointments
- User-friendly interface for both doctors and patients

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite
- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: SQLite

### Now we are migrating to node backend for future

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Latish705/Appoint-next.git
```

## Running the Client (Frontend)

Navigate to the `client` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running the Server (Backend)

Navigate to the `server` directory and set up the backend:

If you are in the root folder where you cloned the repository:

```bash
cd server
```

If you are in the `client` directory:

```bash
cd ..
cd server
```

### Setting Up the Python Environment

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Setup

Since we're using SQLite, there's no need for additional database setup. Just apply the migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser to access the Django admin:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Running the Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The backend should now be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
